tighten up jump
	feels like it should be slightly snappier (on jump release) at the top and less snappy at the bottom (maybe an s curve?)


everything that interacts with the drill is on the enemies layer including tiles


could make a helper class with static helper functions for example to handle:
	unhit_polygon.polygon = hit_polygon.polygon
	unhit_polygon.position = hit_polygon.position
just set unhit_polygon and hit_polygon as parameters to a helper function


player can barely reach 7 tiles apart

turn coyote time down


use a marker2d or something w position to set location of where like jump dust should come from

player sprite might not even need arms

ability where you thrown bubble thing out in front above and you can pogo reset off it
	maybe you can charge to throw it further for dash before
