slug movement
	gonna make a left and right detector to see if the floor ends and turn around if so

now what... maybe design a short intro where you get the jump very quickly and the drill soon after

attempt refactoring body/area type checks in player.gd (didn't work)

seeing if player scene can actually be centered at the origin (worked!)

considering making a lever so the section im making makes more sense

looking up and down w right stick
	- create a tween for this
