BEST SOLUTION:
	----- REDACTED------ position top left (instead of center) of CollisionShape2D and Polygon2D at origin of player scene ----- REDACTED------
	turn on rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel
		- This might be all it takes it seems...

possible hack fixes for how if I use proper crisp pixel settings the collision shape goes 1 pixel into the ground
	use stretch mode: canvas_items
	use stretch scale instead of stretch mode
	turn on rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel
	make player character even # of pixels tall and wide + turn on rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel
