BEST SOLUTION:
	position top left (instead of center) of CollisionShape2D and Polygon2D at origin of player scene
	position origin of player scene at top left of CollisionShape2D and Polygon2D (instead of at center)
	+ turn on rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel

possible hack fixes for how if I use proper crisp pixel settings the collision shape goes 1 pixel into the ground
	use stretch mode: canvas_items
	use stretch scale instead of stretch mode
	turn on rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel
	make player character even # of pixels tall and wide + turn on rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel
